# hexml

hexml is a small system for parsing and streaming XML in java.

Hexml was first written in 1998, simultaneously in C++ and java, as part of a rewrite of an HTML
template system at Destiny (soon to be released as well).  I intended to replace the parser with a
real XML parser like Xerces, but had a lot of trouble due to the fact that I wanted to parse
incorrect XML syntax, or rather, correct syntax *embedded* in highly incorrect stuff!
