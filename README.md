# hexml

hexml is a small system for parsing and streaming XML in java. It was extracted from another
internal project at Destiny Software call the pattern server, as the first step in releasing that
system as an open source project. That never happened at that time, but look for it here.

See the file README-original.txt for more details and the folder docs for in-depth documentation.

hexml 1.0 was originally released under the GPL in 2000 and never maintained, therefore I am
re-releasing it under the UNLICENSE.  It was written to the JDK at that time, so whether it works
under Java of today is unknown.
