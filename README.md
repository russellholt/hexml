# hexml

hexml is a small system for parsing and streaming XML and XML-like text, in java in 1999-2000.
It was extracted from another internal project I did at Destiny (which had become Destiny
WebSolutions) called the _pattern server_, as the first step in releasing that system as an open
source project.  That never happened back then, but look for it here.

hexml served as the basis for an interesting hierarchical template system in the _pattern server_
that is still to my knowlege unique.

See the file README-original.txt for more details and the folder docs for in-depth documentation.

hexml 1.0 was originally released under the GPL in 2000 and never maintained. I am re-releasing it
under the UNLICENSE.  It was originally written to the JDK 1.17, so whether it works under Java of
today is unknown.
